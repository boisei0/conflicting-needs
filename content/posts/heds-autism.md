Normally when I put posts like these online that are less personal, they're extensively researched, and it's usually based on reviews or overview studies linking everything together. Today's post is still mostly based on published studies, but I'm not aware of any linking everything together like I do here. I'll immediately admit I'm nervous putting this online. 

This is a topic that is close to heart. As some of you might know, I was assigned male at birth (amab). I was diagnosed autistic when I was 7, in 2001. For years, all of my clumsiness or bad motor skills were pushed on my autism, because those were commonly seen in boys with autism. I would roll my ankle whenever I tried to run, and I was so used to shaking my leg around for my ankle to slip back in place, that it was only recently I realised I would dislocate my ankle a lot. 

After I came out as transgender in 2015, I started a feminising hormone treatment of oestrogen (E) and testosterone (T) blockers in 2016. For 5 years I struggled to get my hormonal levels stable at a high enough level. My MCAS triggers include most of the inactive ingredients of the oestrogen medication I got. Over the last year I've worked closely with my endocrinologist to increase my dosage, as well as experiment with ways of taking them. I nowadays take E at 3 times the normal maximum a day, at two different moments, both with antihistamines. If I miss a dose, or don't time it well with antihistamines, I feel the fluctuating effects of hormonal levels. 

Two years ago I had to stop my T-blockers, and we've since been looking into other options. The first option is a diuretic, which means I can't have it with POTS. The second option is a GnRH agonist. A couple months ago I've decided to postpone all T-blocker options until my weight is at a safe and stable level. As such, my T levels have been increasing again for the last few years. If I miss a dosage of E, these levels slip down. I don't have an actual cycle, but I can feel similar effects hormonal. If my joints suddenly start slipping out more, I first check environmental factors. And then check to see if I may have missed taking my medication. 

If you've been in hEDS patient communities for a while, you'll probably have come across discussions regarding the laxity of joints around parts of the menstrual cycle. And as you probably know, hEDS is diagnosed a lot in people assigned female at birth (afab). In my personal opinion, overdiagnosed in afab people. The same way as autism is overdiagnosed in amab people. Overdiagnosed, because a lot of afab people with autism slip under the radar and are missed. Overdiagnosed, because amamb people experiencing joint hypermobility or linked connective tissue problems, often are missed until an afab family member is diagnosed.

There's a few things I strongly noticed when I was starting hormone treatment back in 2016. I was supposed to get softer skin, but it never happened. Yet doctors would fawn over me at the appointments after I started on E, because my skin was so soft and they had hardly ever seen such amazing results so quickly. I tried to correct them that nothing had changed, but they would't believe me. I had several doctors ask me if they would be allowed to pet or stroke my skin, to feel if it was as soft as it looked, including my own GP at the time who had known me for over a decade. 

Another thing that I noticed was that my autism began to change. I had been in outpatient therapy specifically for autism until a year prior to that, which had been focused at providing me ways to cope with my autism and function in society. I no longer agree with that therapy, but that's a story for another day. Everything I had learnt during the therapy stopped being relevant after 2 months of HRT. The problems I had before, mainly aimed at communication, were much less of an issue. At the time, the differences typically observed between ASD in amab vs ASD in afab people was the reality I started living. My autism shifted from the stereotypical amab shapes that lead to my diagnosis at a young age, to the more afab linked symptoms. Therapy aimed at learning me scripts to camouflage in society, but camouflaging is still exhausting but I no longer had to think of doing it, and can just as easily drop the mask when around other ND folks. 

And finally, I noticed that around the time I started on E and T-blockers, my joint pain, dizziness and other issues began to increase, as well as my fatigue. My endocrinologist at the time tried a few different dosages over a longer period of time, but to no avail. In hindsight I do know that the first types of antihistamines had to be switched out because I started reacting to inactive ingredients: MCAS. When I went in for a baseline measurement of bone density in 2016, they found osteoporosis without a clear cause. Sure, I couldn't have (a lot of) dairy, but at that age even with a lack of dairy I shouldn't have had that bad levels. My personal theory on this is the involvement of MCAS as well. 

Over the years I've had a particular interest in the overlap between hormones with everything else going on. When I was diagnosed with EDS in 2020, things started making sense. But it wasn't just hormones linking things together. A couple days ago I tried mapping out connections between the different syndromes, and how they affect each other. I actually got a bit dizzy, trying to keep track of all these arrows pointing to each other. After all, it's not _just_ the hEDS you experience, but so many of linked conditions as well. Dysautonomia with POTS or dysmotility and other GI issues. MCAS wreaking havoc over your body, which then affects the rest as well.

It was during conversations with fellow zebras that things started to make sense. Like how many (afab) zebras out there that I know have (suspected) autism as well. Or the comments nurses would make during appointments, like how I always was asked if I did use blood thinners when blood was taken, yet other times it would be really hard to get it out. Heparin is a mediator released by mast cells at the same time as histamine. It's a vasodilator which makes blood vessels more permeable. This is seen in anaphylaxis, for example, but if you're like me and have the injection as an MCAS trigger with a heparin flood released as well as histamine at that spot, you get more extensive bleeding. Extending a special thanks here to Charlotte ([@dazzling_zebra](https://www.instagram.com/dazzling_zebra/)), who made the comment linking heparin release to causing POTS flares through being a vasodilator. With POTS, again, being the same kind of overdiagnosed in afab people.

Putting it all together, things make sense. I don't see the hormonal involvement in amab people with autism. Not directly at least. I do see hormonal links around afab people with hEDS. And the amab people in the same families with autism, who also show symptoms of hypermobility. Whose afab parent then has issues with poor wound healing, but wouldn't consider themselves flexible. Or whose joint issues are explained with other reasons instead. How many families are out there like mine? I'm the first to be diagnosed, but I'm definitely not the only one. Autistic cousins who also show signs of hypermobility. Parents with other connective tissue problems, which together have been dubbed as "family trait" instead. And I wonder, would mine have been spotted if my hormones didn't get involved in the mix?

# Full transcription of the infographic:

## hEDS and autism (page 1)
### On the impact of hormones
In the top left corner is a stylised zebra drawing visible with the instagram handle of the author below (@afelix0). The left half of the page contains two venn diagrams as illustration. One shows overlap between the two terms "Autism" and "hEDS", the second venn diagram shows overlap between the terms "POTS", "hEDS" and "MCAS". On the right side the following text is shown:
Sex hormones have a known effect on:
- E2 (17-β-Estradiol) is a powerful mast cell degranulator (**MCAS**)
- Leukotriene C₄ is increased during perimenstrual phase (**MCAS**, asthma)
- Histamine levels during the estrus cycle in rats (linked to **MCAS**)
- There's been several studies into joint laxity in pregnancy as linked to oestrogen and progesterone levels, as well as joint injuries in menstrual cycle, with mixed results. (**EDS**)

## hEDS and autism (page 2)
### On the impact of hormones
In the top left corner is a stylised zebra drawing visible with the instagram handle of the author below (@afelix0). This page has two columns of text. The left column says the following:
#### Anecdotal connections with/through hormones:
- Within the patient community there's many stories of increased joint laxity and dislocations during menstruation (**hEDS**)
- Heparin is released by mast cells at the same time as histamine. It is a vasodilator and (spontaneous) bleeding has been observed before with **MCAS**. However, it making blood vessels more permeable in general can cause **POTS** flares.
- There might be a link on GnRH/LH/FSH and **dysmotility**, but I don't see clear studies supporting that linked back to sex hormones directly rather than through GnRH agonists.
The right column contains the following:
#### The link to autism:
Autism is mostly diagnosed in amab people. hEDS is mostly diagnosed in afab people. There's an overlap in families with both autism and hEDS. Several cohort studies have been done into a link between ASD and GJH /HSD/hEDS. Gensemer et al mentioned this in their 2020 review as well. 

Unexplained symptoms occasionally seen in amab ASD include clumsiness, frequent injuries and bad fine motor skills (often with pain). These can go unnoticed for years and are instead attributed to autism, rather than HSD/hEDS.
