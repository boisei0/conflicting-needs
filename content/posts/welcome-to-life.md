Welcome to life on the intersection of conflicting needs. Where treatment for one thing is a contra indication of the next. Where therapy for one mental illness is a severe trigger for another. 

Where exposure and response prevention would have been good for OCD, if the response to the exposure is a PTSD induced panic attack, response prevention means  not being allowed to fall back to safety, and reliving the same traumatic experience over and over, as the OCD therapy tells you this is an irrational fear. 

Where osteoporosis is treated with movement, and any kind of activity that puts vertical, gravitational, force on the bones is preferred: jogging, dancing, jump roping... and where all of these are listed as “activities that should be evaded with hypermobile Ehlers Danlos”. 

Where physical assistance is needed more and more, but the kind of help needed would also trigger PTSD and result in flashbacks and panic attacks. Or result in so much gender dysphoria that you’d rather just avoid it altogether. 

Where you’ve become used to doctors explaining in every possible way that they’ve run out of options. That everything you’re dealing with is simply a trick of the mind. It’s between your ears. That it’s yet another medically unexplained symptom. One for the collection of mental diagnoses. 

Welcome to the life of a nonbinary autistic zebra with undiagnosed severe ME. With so many co-morbidities that it stopped being funny a long time ago. Where new symptoms are checked with long lists first, then checked for potential new co-morbidities second, and finally crowdsourced before doctors are even involved. (Where the cake is truly a lie, as safe foods might no longer be safe by the next day)

A life where new ideas are carefully thought out, properly prepared, and by the time they’re rolled out, the baseline of health has worsened beyond what the idea was supposed to solve. A life where worlds are invented, stories written, or prepared to be written only to be stopped by OCD induced writer’s block perfectionism the second a medium is found to write it on. Where blogs have been started before and abandoned after an amount of time without even a notice or a head’s up. 

A life of dreams and wishes, that have to be scrapped one after another, for simply no longer being possible. Where houses seem both too small and too large at the same time. Where life is centred around the bedroom. Where seasons pass, yet every day seems the same. Where an ongoing pandemic doesn’t limit your activities, after all they would be stopped too if you could go outside. 

Welcome to the life on the intersection of conflicting needs, and where a baseline of health rapidly declines because of that conflict.
