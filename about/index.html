From that point onwards, all new odd things were all written off to the autism. Bad motor skills? Autism. Clumsiness where I twisted my ankle several times an hour, stubbed my toes too many times to count? Autism. Bruising? Surely, that&rsquo;s because you hit against objects all the time, autism indirectly. Anxiety? Oh yes, that&rsquo;s common with autism.</p><p>It took two decades to get the diagnoses that were missed in the years that followed. And many misdiagnoses to get to the point where I&rsquo;m now.</p><p>I was 4 or 5 years old when the first traumatic experience happened. Or the first as far as I&rsquo;m aware. By the time of writing, I&rsquo;ve recovered 25 individual or longer term traumatic experiences. The latest of those is related to the way The Netherlands is handling the response to the ongoing pandemic. The rest is a mixture of near death experiences, deaths witnessed, being threatened with weapons, things that technically can be described as attempted murder&mldr; Anxiety, caused by autism, surely you can&rsquo;t mean that? I was 26 when I was finally diagnosed with PTSD. My psychologist at the time was certain it couldn&rsquo;t be PTSD. Sure, I had experienced some events that could be named traumatic, but the anxiety came from the autism? the day after the diagnosis session she suddenly started saying she always thought it would have been PTSD.</p><p>And that&rsquo;s about the story of most diagnoses so far: &ldquo;Surely it can&rsquo;t be X, it is probably just another manifestation of Y&rdquo; to &ldquo;I aways thought it was X&rdquo;. Exhausting. If only that was the only thing causing my fatigues.</p><p>In 2017, I first learnt about ME. I felt seen, finally an explanation for the way I keep crashing after I overdo things. The neurologist responded that he, like many others in his discipline, didn&rsquo;t believe ME existed in the first place, so he definitely couldn&rsquo;t attempt to rule it out. After all, why would you rule out an imaginary thing, I can see written on his face.</p><p>In 2020, I finally got a diagnosis for the physical ongoing things: H-HSD, basically the historical/self diagnosis version of hypermobile Ehlers Danlos. My body had worsened beyond the point where hEDS could be diagnosed. My connective tissue is faulty. If you can&rsquo;t connect the issues, think connective tissue. Things started making sense. Aspects I never thought about before suddenly became symptoms. Symptoms I thought were just part of what being me was like, or failed to notice other people don&rsquo;t experience that.</p><p>Connective tissue is one of the building blocks of the human body. It&rsquo;s everywhere, and with it, the list of common co-morbidities is long. Most of these are medically suspected, rather than diagnosed. And that&rsquo;s okay for me at this stage. I know what&rsquo;s wrong, and how to deal with it.</p><p>In late 2020, I also learnt that I&rsquo;m nonspeaking. But Lena, I&rsquo;ve heard you talk, that can&rsquo;t be true, you might say. That was quite confusing for me to discover too. I can speak, and I do at times. I answer questions, and can start conversations without being prompted. But by default, I don&rsquo;t speak, and am often incapable of speaking. And this calming feeling came over me, when I realised that&rsquo;s okay for me. I don&rsquo;t have to speak to communicate. That you&rsquo;re reading this is proof of that.</p><p>In no particular order, here&rsquo;s a list of things going on that I deem important or might talk about on this blog. Some diagnosed, others not so much.</p><ul><li>Autism</li><li>OCD</li><li>PTSD</li><li>Osteoporosis</li><li>H-HSD/hEDS</li><li>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)</li><li>Severe ME</li><li>Dysautonomia</li><li>Orthostatic Intolerance</li><li>&mldr;</li></ul></div></div></div></main></body></html>
